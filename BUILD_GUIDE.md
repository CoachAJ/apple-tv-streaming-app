# Build Guide for Apple TV Streaming App

## 🚨 Build Error Resolution

**Exit Code 66** typically indicates Xcode build configuration issues. I've fixed the GitHub Actions workflow to resolve common problems.

## Build Options for LambdaTest

### Option 1: Codemagic (Recommended for IPA Generation) 🥇

**Why Codemagic?**
- Supports Apple Developer signing
- Can generate actual IPA files for device testing
- Free tier available for open source projects

**Setup Steps:**
1. Go to [codemagic.io](https://codemagic.io/)
2. Sign up with GitHub account
3. Connect repository: `CoachAJ/apple-tv-streaming-app`
4. Use existing `codemagic.yaml` configuration
5. Configure Apple Developer credentials (if available)
6. Start build → Download IPA

**Configuration File:** `codemagic.yaml` (already included)

### Option 2: GitHub Actions (Build Validation) ✅

**What it does:**
- Validates code compiles correctly
- Runs on every push/PR
- Tests tvOS simulator build
- **Cannot generate IPA** (requires Apple Developer signing)

**Current Status:** Fixed and working
- Removed archiving steps that require signing
- Focuses on build validation
- Provides confidence that code is correct

### Option 3: Local Build (Mac Required) 💻

**Prerequisites:**
- macOS with Xcode installed
- Apple Developer account (for device builds)

**Commands:**
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x build_for_testing.sh

# Run build
./build_for_testing.sh
```

### Option 4: Alternative Cloud Services

**Bitrise:** Similar to Codemagic, supports iOS/tvOS builds
**CircleCI:** Requires paid plan for macOS builds
**Travis CI:** Limited free tier for open source

## Understanding the Build Error

**Exit Code 66** commonly occurs due to:

1. **Missing Signing Certificates** ❌
   - GitHub Actions can't access Apple Developer certificates
   - Solution: Use Codemagic with proper signing setup

2. **Incorrect Project Paths** ✅ Fixed
   - Workflow was looking in wrong directory
   - Solution: Updated paths in `.github/workflows/build-tvos.yml`

3. **Missing Dependencies** ✅ Not applicable
   - Project uses only system frameworks
   - No external dependencies to install

4. **Xcode Version Mismatch** ✅ Handled
   - Workflow uses `latest-stable` Xcode version
   - Compatible with current project settings

## Recommended Workflow for LambdaTest

### For Testing on LambdaTest Devices:

1. **Use Codemagic for IPA Generation**
   ```
   Codemagic → Build with Signing → Download IPA → Upload to LambdaTest
   ```

2. **Use GitHub Actions for Code Validation**
   ```
   GitHub → Automatic build validation → Confidence in code quality
   ```

### For Development:

1. **GitHub Actions validates every change**
2. **Codemagic generates IPA when ready for testing**
3. **LambdaTest provides device testing environment**

## Build Configuration Files

### ✅ Ready Files:
- `codemagic.yaml` - Codemagic CI/CD configuration
- `.github/workflows/build-tvos.yml` - GitHub Actions (fixed)
- `build_for_testing.sh` - Local Mac build script
- `build_for_testing.ps1` - Windows helper script
- `StreamingApp/ExportOptions.plist` - Export settings

### 🔧 Configuration Notes:
- **Team ID**: Set to placeholder, update in Codemagic settings
- **Signing**: Configured for development builds
- **Bitcode**: Disabled (recommended for tvOS testing)

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub Actions Issues:
- **Check Actions tab**: https://github.com/CoachAJ/apple-tv-streaming-app/actions
- **View logs**: Click on failed workflow run
- **Common fixes**: Already implemented in latest workflow

### Codemagic Issues:
- **Signing errors**: Add Apple Developer certificates in settings
- **Build timeouts**: Use smaller build configurations
- **API limits**: Check free tier usage

### Local Build Issues:
- **Xcode not found**: Install Xcode from App Store
- **Signing errors**: Configure Apple Developer account in Xcode
- **Permission denied**: Run `chmod +x build_for_testing.sh`

## Next Steps

1. **✅ GitHub Actions**: Now working for build validation
2. **🎯 Codemagic Setup**: Recommended for IPA generation
3. **📱 LambdaTest Upload**: Use generated IPA for device testing

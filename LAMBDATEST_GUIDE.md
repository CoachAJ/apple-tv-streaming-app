# LambdaTest tvOS Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive instructions for testing the Apple TV Streaming App on LambdaTest.com cloud testing platform.

## Prerequisites

### 1. LambdaTest Account Setup
- Sign up at [LambdaTest.com](https://www.lambdatest.com/)
- Navigate to **Real Device Testing** → **App Testing**
- Select **iOS** platform for tvOS testing

### 2. Required Files for Upload

#### A. App Binary (.ipa file)
You'll need to build and export the app as an IPA file. Use one of these methods:

**Method 1: Using Xcode (Requires Mac)**
```bash
# Archive the project
xcodebuild -project StreamingApp.xcodeproj \
           -scheme StreamingApp \
           -destination 'generic/platform=tvOS' \
           -configuration Release \
           archive -archivePath build/StreamingApp.xcarchive

# Export IPA
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
           -archivePath build/StreamingApp.xcarchive \
           -exportPath build \
           -exportOptionsPlist StreamingApp/ExportOptions.plist
```

**Method 2: Using Codemagic CI/CD (Recommended for Windows)**
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to [Codemagic.app](https://codemagic.io/)
3. Use the provided `codemagic.yaml` configuration
4. Download the generated IPA from build artifacts

#### B. Test Configuration Files
- `Info.plist` - App configuration
- `ExportOptions.plist` - Export settings
- `VIMEO_CREDENTIALS.md` - API credentials (for reference)
